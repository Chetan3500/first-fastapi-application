# First FastAPI Application

FastAPI is a Python framework for building APIs with asynchronous programming. It’s fast (comparable to Node.js and Go), supports type hints for automatic validation, and generates interactive API documentation (via Swagger UI). It’s built on **Starlette** for web handling and **Pydantic** for data validation.
